# Coursera_Python_Project_Assignment
My submission for the Coursera Python for Data Science Project
This was a project that used websrapping to extract data using python packages from companies; their stock and revenue data. 
It used this data to display graphs that showed the peaks periods of stock prices and revenues.
Generally, I got better at using python packegs this way.
